Create an Android application that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a Recycler View. For this question, let us consider the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) which provides placeholder data for testing and prototyping.
Your task is to: 
1. Fetch a list of posts from the API endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
2. Display the fetched posts in a Recycler View.
3. Each item in the Recycler View should show the title and body of a post.
4. Implement a click listener for Recycler View items to show a toast with the post's ID when clicked.
